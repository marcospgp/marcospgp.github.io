Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Marcos, a developer from Portugal.

My focus is in AI and games, and my professional background also includes a lot of backend web development.

I [publish]({% post_url 2022-01-10-i-just-published-polygon-reducer-on-the-unity-asset-store %}) on the Unity asset store and have done [some research]({% post_url 2020-11-01-ml-collective-arc %}) at MLC, a lab led by Rosanne Liu from Google Brain.

If you're looking for a resume, I keep one up to date [at Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/marcos-pereira).

If you wish to get in touch, do [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/voxelbased) or send an email to &#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#109;&#101;.

If you are interested in staying up to date on what I'm working on and finding out when I post something new, Twitter is also currently the best way to do that.
