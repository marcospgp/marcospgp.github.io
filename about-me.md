Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Marcos, a developer from Portugal with a focus on web, machine learning, and games.

I've done some [deep learning research]({% post_url 2020-11-01-ml-collective-arc %}) at the Machine Learning Collective, under Rosanne Liu from Google DeepMind.

I have also [published]({% post_url 2022-01-10-i-just-published-polygon-reducer-on-the-unity-asset-store %}) on the Unity asset store.

You can check out my resume [here](/resume).

If you wish to get in touch, do [reach out on X](https://x.com/voxelbased) or send an email to &#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#109;&#101;.

If you are interested in staying up to date on what I'm working on and finding out when I post something new, X is also currently the best way to do that.
