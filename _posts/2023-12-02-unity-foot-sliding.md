How to set up player movement in the Unity engine where the speed is set by a script and animation root motion is not applied, but synchronize the two in order to avoid issues such as foot sliding.

## The problem

In animation blend trees, root motion isn't linearly blended. Blending halfway towards a forward movement animation will not result in a root motion with half that animation's speed.

This likely has to do with things like foot phase synchronization. More info on this is available at <https://kybernetik.com.au/animancer/docs/manual/blending/mixers/synchronization/>.

## The solution

The key aspect to work around non-linear root motion blending is to not blend root motion at all. Instead, we can manipulate the speed of animations with known root motion velocity in order to match in-game player velocity.

We still use a blend tree to simplify transitioning between different movement animations, even though we aim to always end up with a single active animation.

Here's the step by step approach:

1. Set up blend tree
   - 2D simple directional (no idle animation)
   - 8 directional animations (minimize velocity difference when blending - for example, blending a forward with a sideways animation can result in diagonal movement that is slower than either of the other animations individually. Blending animation root motion is poorly documented.)
   - Adjust animation speeds so that each has a resulting velocity of 1m/s
     1. Compute positions -> Velocity XZ
     2. Divide animation speed by norm of velocity
   - Reset animation positions to unit circle coordinates
   - Set blend tree animation direction through X and Y parameters connected to user input
   - Adjust blend tree speed by setting a parameter to be equal to the player's speed
2. Transition to/from idle animation
   - Idle animation cannot be in blend tree as the blend tree's speed will be modified
   - Blending between idle and movement animations is unreliable anyway in terms of resulting velocity (unpredictable, non-linear)

This is what the resulting blend tree looks like:

It may be possible to still blend between movement and other animations by nesting blend trees, although copy pasting a blend tree you previously created [requires a simple workaround](https://x.com/voxelbased/status/1720082569260343547).
