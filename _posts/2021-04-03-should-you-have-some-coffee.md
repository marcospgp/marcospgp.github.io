title: Should you have some coffee?
---

I like coffee. Though sometimes, I'm not sure whether I should have it,
especially when it's late in the day or I've already had some.

So I took to doing some research and built up a little questionaire to help
guide my reasoning.

It's not serious or strictly scientific, but I did my best to rely on well
thought and unbiased data.

You can find it here: [shouldyouhavesome.coffee](shouldyouhavesome.coffee)

I have to admit, I don't always guide my actions by it - in a bit of a self
destructive manner. I am inclined to believe that even if something is harmful,
we subconsciously may prefer to take the reins of our fate and command our own
suffering.

That aside, let me know what you think!
