I built a questionnaire that helps one decide whether to have some coffee, in part as an effort to convince myself it would be worth it to reduce my caffeine consumption once in a while.

You can find it at [shouldyouhavesomecoffee.netlify.app](https://shouldyouhavesomecoffee.netlify.app/), and the source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/marcospgp/should-you-have-some-coffee).

I built it in a generic way where the questions and their respective scores are [defined independently](https://github.com/marcospgp/should-you-have-some-coffee/blob/main/questions.js) of the functionality, so theoretically one could easily change this into any other yes/no questionnaire.

I have to admit, I don't always guide my actions by this - I am inclined to believe that even if something is harmful, we subconsciously may prefer to take the reins of our fate and command our own suffering.

That aside, let me know what you think!
