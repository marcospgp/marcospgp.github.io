title: Applying Neural Cellular Automata to the ARC Challenge
tag: AI ðŸ¤–
---

I reached out to the ML Collective about tackling the [ARC challenge](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC), a dataset of grid-based abstraction and reasoning puzzles.

I ended up [building a model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DUwnEdZmpVfE7CPbdoOyfkrqKl--HhM/view?usp=sharing) based on neural cellular automata and [presenting the results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/132JpBFTwP3vKHPBXb60mPfS2U9jVKQleSZ-oesHJh8Y/edit?usp=sharing) to other researchers in the community.

The model solved 14 out of 262 tasks, while a baseline convolutional model with residual connections solved 12.
These models contrast in the number of parameters - while the neural cellular automata based model has 18 062, the baseline has 446 410.

After this, I started working on a [domain specific language](https://github.com/marcospgp/abstraction-and-reasoning) that I hoped a language model could be trained with, but did not see it through. I also wrote [some documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aUkZLC7U7QMj2LMAuh8fhUc_NS-SV9_x4YsxXGJQqGc/edit?usp=sharing) for it.

In late 2022, the ARC challenge remains unsolved.
