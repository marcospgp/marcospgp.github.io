title: "Ideas For Startups by Paul Graham: A Hierarchical Reading"

I summarized [Paul Graham's "Ideas For Startups" essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html) in an experimental reading format that I believe has a lot of potential.

The text starts out in an easy to skim, summarized format, and particular sections can be expanded from their base idea to get into more detail.

Here is the text:

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Would you write in this format if there were a platform that made it easy? Would you prefer reading long form text in a format like this over being presented the text in a long continuous block?
