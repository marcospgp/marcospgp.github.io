Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Marcos, a developer from Portugal.

I am mainly interested in working on games and machine learning.

I also do some moderation on Lex Fridman's Discord and subreddit - check out the podcast, it's great! My favorite episode so far is [the one with John Carmack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4).

If you wish to get in touch, do reach out on Twitter or send an email to &#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#109;&#101;.
