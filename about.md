Hello! Thanks for visiting my website.

I am Marcos, a developer from Portugal.

Many years ago GTA San Andreas opened my eyes to how amazing and immersive virtual worlds can be. I now work towards making these worlds more alive. I believe that anything we create in them can be a source of inspiration for and will certainly spill over into base reality.

I identify with and mostly live by stoic philosophy. I tend to overthink things I care about and underthink things I am not interested in. I am trying to lean more towards action, but am bothered by the idea of imperfection. I still haven't figured out how to sleep well or how much coffee I should have.

If you wish to get in touch, you can reach out to me through the links in the footer, or email me <a href="&#109;a&#105;l&#116;&#111;:&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#109;&#101;">here</a>.
