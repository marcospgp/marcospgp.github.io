This is where I keep notes for things I keep revisiting throughout my work.

## Animations

### Mixamo

Downloading animations "without skin" prevents wasting memory with unnecessary models.
However, the avatar generated by Unity for these won't work properly.
That can be fixed by downloading the default Mixamo character (Y Bot) in T-pose and generating an avatar from it, which will work with Mixamo animations.

## LODs

- Only the last LOD matters
- Impostors > LOD meshes
- Advancements like Nanite can change 3D lore fast
