This is where I keep notes for things I keep revisiting throughout my work.

## Unity game dev

Utilities repo: <https://github.com/marcospgp/unity-utilities>

### Animations

#### Importing

- "bake into pose" root transform changes that shouldn't be applied to the gameobject on each animation.

#### Mixamo

Downloading animations "without skin" prevents wasting memory with unnecessary models.
However, the avatar generated by Unity for these won't work properly.
That can be fixed by downloading the default Mixamo character (Y Bot) in T-pose and generating an avatar from it, which can then be used with "without skin" Mixamo animations.

### Blender

#### Settings

- Disable saving `.blend1` files

#### Unity interop

- Store `.blend` files directly inside the Unity project's "Assets" folder
- There doesn't seem to be a way to store textures in `.blend` file, so keep them in "Assets" folder and use them in both Blender and Unity

### LODs

- Only the last LOD matters
- Impostors > LOD meshes
- Advancements like Nanite can change 3D lore fast

### Math

## General development

### Git

- Commit without a message: `git commit -a --allow-empty-message -m ''`
