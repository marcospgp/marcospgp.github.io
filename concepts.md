## From Stephen Wolfram

- [Computational irreducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility)
- [Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30)

## Statistics

- [Regression toward the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean)

## Society

- [The emperor has no clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes)
- [Mind virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viruses_of_the_Mind)

## Disqualified

- [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect): a case of [autocorrelation](https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2022/04/08/the-dunning-kruger-effect-is-autocorrelation/).

  If people had random judgments of their performance, plotting the difference between these and their actual performance would still surface the reported effect, simply due to [regression to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean).

  In a way the concept is still valid, but its only conclusion should be that people tend towards the mean when judging their performance.

  Most of all, this paper is a lesson in poor graph design and the power of memes and [herd mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality).
