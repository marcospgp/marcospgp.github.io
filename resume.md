Developer based in [Porto, Portugal](https://goo.gl/maps/AAJhJkfqMChWV19s6).

Main interests: machine learning, games, and web.

- Experience with ML engineering and research, including as a research lab member at the [Machine Learning Collective](https://twitter.com/ml_collective) under [Rosanne Liu](https://twitter.com/savvyRL) from Google DeepMind;
- Extensive backend web development background;
- Game development experience includes successful Unity asset store publishing.

Full time availability, and open to traveling periodically.

Value smart colleagues, small teams, good code culture (documentation, code reviews, integration tests), challenging problems, and freedom to suggest priorities & approaches.

## Experience

## Side projects

Working on my own projects is a large part of what I spend my time on. Below are some of the things I've done.

### Machine learning

- [Derived backpropagation from scratch](https://marcospereira.me/2022/08/18/backpropagation-from-scratch/) for learning purposes
- [Applied neural cellular automata models to the abstraction and reasoning corpus](https://marcospereira.me/2020/11/01/ml-collective-arc/) as part of my research at MLC

### Game development

- Published a [mesh optimization tool](https://marcospereira.me/2022/01/10/i-just-published-polygon-reducer-on-the-unity-asset-store/) in the Unity asset store (my first profitable side project)
- Researched [frame rate independent linear interpolation](https://marcospereira.me/2022/08/24/lerp-how-to-frame-rate-independent/) (a 3-part blog post series)
- Implemented [Fowler–Noll–Vo 1a hash in C#](https://marcospereira.me/2022/05/10/a-simple-hash-for-perlin-noise/) as part of my efforts towards infinite procedural terrain generation with a graph-based UI

### Web

- Built [flappy goat](https://github.com/marcospgp/flappygoat), a web-based clone of the hit mobile game, in pure JavaScript
- Published [Twitter Infinite Scroll Disabler](https://github.com/marcospgp/twitter-infinite-scroll-disabler), a browser extension that replaced Twitter's infinite scroll with a "show more" button
- Built a modular web questionnaire scaffolding and published [should you have some coffee](https://github.com/marcospgp/should-you-have-some-coffee)
- Built [Watch Together](https://github.com/marcospgp/watch-together), a browser extension for synchronizing video players across multiple users on a popular web streaming service
- [Set up a VPS](https://marcospereira.me/2023/03/13/vps/) in a repeatable way, with zero manual steps
- Wrote a [checklist for using SQLite](https://marcospereira.me/2023/02/14/checklist-for-sqlite/) on personal web projects in the safest & cleanest possible way
