Developer based in [Porto, Portugal](https://goo.gl/maps/AAJhJkfqMChWV19s6).

Main areas of focus: web, machine learning, and 3D games & simulations.

- 10+ years of experience building products on the web;
- Expert on state of the art machine learning & research lab member at the [Machine Learning Collective](https://twitter.com/ml_collective) under [Rosanne Liu](https://twitter.com/savvyRL) (Google DeepMind);
- Extensive experience with the Unity engine, including as an asset store publisher.

Value smart colleagues, small teams, good code culture (documentation, code reviews, integration tests), challenging problems, and freedom to suggest priorities & approaches.

Open to traveling periodically.

## Experience

- Freelancing since high school (2013)
- Software Engineering degree (2015-2018)
- Joined [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/marcos-pereira) in 2017
- Joined [MLC](http://mlcollective.org/) research lab [in 2020](https://marcospereira.me/2020/11/01/ml-collective-arc/)

Some companies I have worked with:

- [Apprentice](https://www.apprentice.io/)
- [Angle Health](https://www.anglehealth.com/)

My full work history is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcosrafaelpereira/).

I have a background in machine learning, data science, web development (focus on backend), and game development (focus on the Unity engine).

Comfortable with any modern language, framework, and library. Happy to pick up new technologies.

Have a lot of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C#, and Bash. Worked with most popular machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.

Operations experience includes setting up, managing, and automating various server processes and CI pipelines.

## Side projects

Working on my own projects is a large part of what I spend my time on. Below are some of the things I've done.

### Machine learning

- [Derived backpropagation from scratch](https://marcospereira.me/2022/08/18/backpropagation-from-scratch/) to develop an intuitive understanding of the algorithm powering modern ML models
- [Applied neural cellular automata models to the abstraction and reasoning corpus](https://marcospereira.me/2020/11/01/ml-collective-arc/) as part of my research at MLC
- Experimented with neural network weight compression using low-rank matrix approximation
- Applied LLMs to NPCs in virtual worlds, triggering actions based on model output

### Game development

- Published a [mesh optimization tool](https://marcospereira.me/2022/01/10/i-just-published-polygon-reducer-on-the-unity-asset-store/) in the Unity asset store (my first profitable side project)
- Researched [frame rate independent linear interpolation](https://marcospereira.me/2022/08/24/lerp-how-to-frame-rate-independent/) (a 3-part blog post series)
- Implemented [Fowler–Noll–Vo 1a hash in C#](https://marcospereira.me/2022/05/10/a-simple-hash-for-perlin-noise/) as part of my procedural generation efforts
- Working on an infinite terrain generator based on a graph editor (inspired by shader graph). Currently looking into using the browser as a UI due to insufficient support for graph-based UIs in the Unity editor.

### Web

- Built [flappy goat](https://github.com/marcospgp/flappygoat), a web-based clone of the hit mobile game, in pure JavaScript
- Published [Twitter Infinite Scroll Disabler](https://github.com/marcospgp/twitter-infinite-scroll-disabler), a browser extension that replaced Twitter's infinite scroll with a "show more" button
- Built a modular web questionnaire scaffolding and published [should you have some coffee](https://github.com/marcospgp/should-you-have-some-coffee)
- Built [Watch Together](https://github.com/marcospgp/watch-together), a browser extension for synchronizing video players across multiple users on a popular web streaming service
- [Set up a VPS](https://marcospereira.me/2023/03/13/vps/) in a repeatable way, with zero manual steps
- Wrote a [checklist for using SQLite](https://marcospereira.me/2023/02/14/checklist-for-sqlite/) on personal web projects in the safest & cleanest possible way
